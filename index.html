                <p>Hi! My name is Tony Bee. I'm 28 years old, and I was born and grew up in Channahon, Illinois; a small town
                about 30 minutes south of Chicago. In high school I played football and enjoyed playing the guitar outside of
                school. I went to college at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, and studied Advertising.</p> 
                
                <p>Upon graduating in 2012, I started working part-time at Baird & Warner Title Services. I've worked there the past
                6 years, working my way up as a part-time scanner to a title examining & underwriting position. 
                In my free time I enjoy reading non-fiction, playing golf, long distance running, and exercise in general.</p>
                
                <p>I've always had and interest in coding and software development, and upon feeling stuck in my current work situation, 
                I signed up for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to seek out other opportunies in the ever-expanding world of software.</p>
