                <p>Hi! My name is Tony Bee. I'm 28 years old, and I was born and grew up in Channahon, Illinois; a small town
                about 30 minutes south of Chicago. In high school I played football and enjoyed playing the guitar outside of
                school. 
                I went to college at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, and studied Advertising. Upon
                graduating in 2012, I started working part-time at Baird & Warner Title Services. I've worked there the past
                6 years, working my way up as a part-time scanner to a title examining & underwriting position. I've always had and interest
                in coding and software development, and upon feeling stuck in my current work situation, I signed up for the 
                Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to seek out other opportunies in the ever-expanding world of software.</p>
